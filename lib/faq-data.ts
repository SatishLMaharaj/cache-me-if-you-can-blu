    question: "How do I complete an Interbank Transfer to a Scotiabank account?",
    answer: `To transfer funds to a Scotiabank account, you can use the "Third Party Local Bank" transfer feature, however, the entire account number must be inserted.

Scotiabank account numbers are 12 digits in length - 5 for the branch (called the transit number) and 7 for the recipient's account number. It therefore means, the total number of digits entered must always be equal to 12.

If the account number is less than 7 digits, the account number is filled with zeros after the transit number so that the total number of digits is 12.

For Example:

The transit number for Scotiabank Park & Pembroke Branch is 10405
The account number to credit is 133256 (this is less than 7 numbers)
To be processed, a zero has to be added after the transit number but before the account number, so that it equals 12. The number will therefore be:
1 0 4 0 50 1 3 3 2 5 6 (This is: Transit Number + 0 + Account Number)`
